#Basics of the computer

##Component of the Component of the computer
###Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU)
**Arithmetic Logic Unit** do mathematical calculations (Arithmetic operations) and the calculation of logic (Logical operations) by operating on calculations including the addition (Addition) delete (Subtraction) multiply (Multiplication) Division (Division) for computing the logical features comparison true or false.

* =,  [Equal to condition]
* <,  [Less than condition]
* >,  [Greater than condition]

##Control unit(CU)
**Control unit**(Control Unit or CU) is the functioning of the control unit. Will be under the command of a program stored in the main memory. The control unit is responsible for the operation and coordination of the implementation of such systems.

* Communicate with the ALU and memory.
* Decide on the news or in and out of main memory.
* sending routing information from memory to the ALU and ALU to the main memory.
* The unit serves to decipher whether the computer what to do.
* According to the decoding process. To get the result.

###Computer data storage
**Secondary Storage** (Secondary Storage or Auxiliary Memory) is a memory that looks more permanent memory. Once saved is not lost. Or oblivious to. There are commands to change. Normal backup memory can store up to ten times the amount that many etch. But there is a downside. Reading data stored out applications will require more time to read the data stored in the main memory

*	Hard disk 
*	Compact Disk 
*	Flash drives

###Input/Output
**Input/Output**(I/O) is imported and displayed in the computer. The term is used to refer to systems and computer display as follows.

* 1. Device to the computer as an aid in data (Input device) which serves to get information from people. And forwarding data to a. Central Processing Unit (CPU: Central Process Unit) of the computer. For further processing, for example, the keyboard (keyboard), mouse. (Mouse), scanners. (Scanner), microphone (Microphone), camera, webcam. (Webcam) etc.
*  2. Equipment that is used in the display of the computer to person. So that people can read. Or get information from your computer (Output device) which serves to display the results of data processing. Of the data processing. For example, a computer printer (Printer), and draw (Plotter), monitor (Monitor), projectors (LCD Projector), speakers, etc. 

###Bus
**BUS system **in microcomputer systems. Although most of the data transmission between microprocessor with external devices through the bus by the microprocessor to control the operation of the bus, not all In some cases, the transfer themselves. The bus was a special case, as well as reading the data from the backup memory size. Can be passed to the main memory through a microprocessor without it. Is by using a process called movement DMA (Direct Memory Access). 

* Data Bus is a bus microprocessor (CPU) is used as a through route to control the transfer of data from the CPU to the external device, or receive data from an external device. The CPU for processing.
* Address Bus is the CPU bus. Choose whether to send or receive data from the device where you will have to send a signal out of the address bus.
* Control Bus is the receiving bus control signals from the CPU by the bus driver. To force it to read the incoming data. Or to send data from the CPU by an external system to respond to the control signal.

###Memory Space
The area is used for Memory Management. I handle all the processing is smooth, it depends.
Performance between the CPU Main Memoy that much more effective. By Main Memory will work to control the allocation of all the User. Run through Operating System can be divided into two types of storage main memory and virtual memory.

* **Main Memory** The Main Memory Address is a large array, which is a lot.And the Address Data with its own well.
* **Virtual Memory** Memory was made in the case of RAM, which is most often not enough space on the hard drive out some substitute.
